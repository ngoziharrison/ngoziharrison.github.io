# $\text{blackness} \cap \text{mathematics} \cap \text{information}$

As long as I can remember I have loved math. Growing up my Dad was a math teacher and research Math and Science Education for Black youth for his PhD. I remember going to work with him at STEM summer programmings while growing up. I also remember being a member of the local NSBE Jr. chapter and loving learning about math, technology, and science. I also remember my parents copy of Blacks in Science edited by Ivan Van Sertima

Often when asked about my research interests I say that my research is in blackness, mathematics, and information. Recently I have been thinking what the right configuration of these topics. An obvious answer would be that I am interested in the intersection of Blackness, Mathematics, and Information which can be written as  However, I have increasingly found that instead of one perfect intersection that brings each of these topics together, there are in fact many ways that blackness, math, and information interact that are worthy of investigation. I constantly return to this formula to consider how I can manifest each of these in the projects I am working on. As some of the readings below indicate, Blackness is subject to a mathematical violence due to the way antiblackness deploys mathematics for the violence and suppression of Black bodies. Racial thinking is codified into classification schemes for the differential 




As a emerging critical information scholar I see the many information technologies, structures and systems we interact with daily as worthy of investigation. In doing this work I think it's important to deal with the fundamental epistemologies and structures that ground these techncial systems. For me this increasingly leads to mathematics. In this work, my point of departure is centering mathematics as a site of inquiry and intervention in order to develop new approaches to mathematical practice and liberatory technologies. Mathematics is a social practice and emerges from culture. mathematics is a cultural product and exists in a dialectical relationship with culture. Daily practices, language, ideology, aesthetics, and material constraints affect and are affected by mathematical knowledge. Mathematics is deeply embedded in a social and historic context which is worthy of investigation.




This is a reading list I have put together which includes the many books, articles, and writings I have encountered in my search for a critical mathematics. Critical mathematics to me is bringing together critical frameworks, historical and genealogical research, and mathematics. My critical engagement with mathematics is specifically concerned with thinking Blackness and Mathematics together. Thinking Blackness and Mathematics does not simply mean recounting a list of Black people who have done mathematics, or proving that Black people are capable of excelling at Mathematics. I am concerned with Understanding the role of AntiBlackness, colonialism, Capitalism, and Western Thought as it is tangled up with mathematics and considering the ways we can concieve of alternative mathematical thought and mathematical practice. This is especially relevant when thinking about how mathematics undergirds much of modern technology and statistics, AI, and Machine Learning have the power that they due because of the epistemological weight we assign to the underlying mathematical techniques. This work necessitates deep engagement with the philosophy of mathematics, many theorems, results, and definitions, history, and Black studies. Reaching both back and forward across time. 

In this work, my point of departure is centering mathematics as a site of inquiry and intervention. This is why while thinking philosophically and critically, I am also in the process of myself learning higher mathematics. Out of love for blackness and mathematics.


This list includes work by scholars who take mathematics as a site of inquiry to investigate the evolution of mathematical concepts and methods in addition to work that I would call is critical mathematical practice. Thinking reflexivily about what it means to do mathematics, and considering other traditions and lineages.

# Questions I am Thinking About
- How might we design logics which expand beyond the bounds of western reason and rationality?
- How does recursion affect our understanding of the relationship between temporality and computation?
- How might the tools of abstraction that we have from mathematics be turned toward revolutionary aims and not function as tools of capital?
- Not a question but I'm just really into category theory as a tool for abstract thinking and drawing connections
- Can we design models of computation based upon non-western logics? There have been examples of this and I think there is more experimental work to be done here
- How do we use mathematical tools for justice?
