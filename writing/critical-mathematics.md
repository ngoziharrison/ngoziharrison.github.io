# $\text{blackness} \cap \text{mathematics} \cap \text{information}$.

As long as I can remember I have loved math. Growing up my Dad was a math teacher and 

Often when asked about my research interests I say that my research is in blackness, mathematics, and and information. Recently I have been thinking what the right configuration of these topics. An obvious answer would be that I am interested in the intersection of Blackness, Mathematics, and Information which can be written as  However, I have increasingly found that instead of one perfect intersection that brings each of these topics together, there are in fact many ways that blackness, math, and information interact that are worthy of investigation. I constantly return to this formula to consider how I can manifest each of these in the projects I am working on. As some of the readings below indicate, Blackness is subject to a mathematical violence due to the way antiblackness deploys mathematics for the violence and surpression of Black bodies. Racial thinking is codified into classification schemes for the differential 




As a emerging critical information scholar I see the many information technologies, structures and systems we interact with daily as worthy of investigation. In doing this work I think it's important to deal with the fundamental epistemologies and structures that ground these techncial systems. For me this increasingly leads to mathematics. In this work, my point of departure is centering mathematics as a site of inquiry and intervention in order to develop new approaches to mathematical practice and liberatory technologies. Mathematics is a social practice and emerges from culture. mathematics is a cultural product and exists in a dialectical relationship with culture. Daily practices, language, ideology, aesthetics, and material constraints affect and are affected by mathematical knowledge. Mathematics is deeply embedded in a social and historic context which is worthy of investigation.




This is a reading list I have put together which includes the many books, articles, and writings I have encountered in my search for a critical mathematics. Critical mathematics to me is bringing together critical frameworks, historical and genealogical research, and mathematics. This research includes work by scholars who take mathematics as a site of inquiry to investigate the evolution of mathematical concepts and methods in addition to work that I would call is critical mathematical practice. Thinking reflexivily about what it means to do mathematics, and considering other traditions and lineages.
