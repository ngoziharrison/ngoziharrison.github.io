If we think of design as joining the technical and aesthetics to create something with utility, then in order to radically reimagine design we have to first deconstruct it to a philosophy of the technical and aesthetics. These philosophies are ultimately encoded in the design principles at play and results of the design process. In the philosophy of the technical we are considering the way we understand the nature of technical things, systems, digital objects etc. The ontological nature of these abstract things and thingness/(no)thingness may seem trivial, however it informs the questions we ask or don't as during the design process and can contribute to alienation. Aesthetics also encodes cultural values and for my work I seek to take inspiration from the radical aesthetics of Sylvia Wynter under/overstands aesthetic practice as always already political and mainstream aesthetic practice often presupposes and enacts a negation of Black being. 

One thing to think about when it comes to the ontology of technics/the technical is that one of the foundational thinkers is this area Heidegger was a Nazi. Now it can be argued how involved or not involved Heidegger was in the party however he never renounced his association publicly and his complicity and compliance with the logics of the Nazi party.

As many scholars and historians have pointed out, the ideology of the Third Reich was informed by the western colonialist projects in North America and Southern Africa with the first concentration camps appearing during the Second Boer War in South Africa. These influences contributed to the conceptualization of the Reich's own philosophy/logic of settler colonialism called the *Lebensraum*.

In the Universal Machine by Fred Moten he engages the radical expressions of phenomenology of Fanon, Levinas and Arendt to argue for a new kind of what he calls Aesthetic sociality. Moten in the preface calling the book a monograph decomposed. This statement holds in it two ideas at odds but that imply a kind of physicality/sensory experience, a temporality and movement. The word monograph speaks of a mono or singular project but this project has been out in the elements a bit too long. It has burst at the seams showing it's internal components and has opened up to  exegesis as autopsy. Phenomenology, ontology, and politics come together as a swarm who's movements and improvisations Moten attempts to trouble and trace to have something useful to say about Black social life. He uses their work as a site for inquiry and point of departure to argue for a social (meta)physics that "violates" Individuation". Permit me to use a rather long quotation from this preface to begin a conversation about these colonialist/genocidal logics and what they have to tell us about technical ontology in design. 

  So I want to argue, or move in preparation of an argument for the necessity of a social (meta)physics that violates individuation. C discourse on the Shoah and on racial slavery, even in their various divergences rightly align mechanization (or a kind of mechanistic rationalization) with de-individuation while also recognizing that individuation—the theft of body—is genocidal operation. Mutually dismissive analytics of gratuitousness notwithstanding the slave ship and the gas chamber are cognate in this regard and, in their separate ways jointly end at the convergence of death and utility (for only one of which either one or the other is supposed to stand)

  ...At that intersection, individuation and de-individuation orbit one another as mutual conditions of im/possibility operating in and as the frigid mechanics of an indifference machines.
  
The mechanization of the Shoah and slavery (in this case we are referring to slavery but ultimately pointing to the entire colonial and genocidal project affecting Africans across the diaspora) are cognates both a same/different kind of genocidal operation with the end result being a convergence of death and utility. The operation seeks the de-individuation of it's subject. For me this brings up two key questions:
- How does the de-individuation machine individuate itself? What are it's internal logics?
- By what process (algorithm) does the machine de-individuate that which has been denied individuality? How can you kill a person who has been denied humanity/subjectivity?
Moten argues that (de)individuation operate as the mechanics of the indifference machine. Simondon, Steigler, and Hui all deal with the process of individuation with the mechanical, technical, and digital. These genocidal projects show how historically the (de)individuation process has enacted through mechanized logics and these systems  were designed informed by ontologies, aesthetics and philosophies. However, the logics have not gone away, These logics take the various European projects of racial categorization to their logical conclusion and Ramon Amaro in his project on The Black Technical Object excavates the origin of Machine Learning from the site of racial categorization. 

There's more to say on this topic and I'll discuss in depth in a forthcoming essay on alienation and Artificial Intelligence. This is an ongoing line of inquiry for me as I work through keys texts on technical ontology and radical Black aesthetics. Here are some of the readings I'm working through:
