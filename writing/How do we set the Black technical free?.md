By analyzing it I hope to destroy it 

––Frantz Fanon

  
In our attempts to make ourselves comprehensible to technological systems and data regimes, we also open ourselves to capture. We cast ourselves through the prism of technology and the digital, scattering into many digital doppelgängers. Through the totalizing subsuming project of big data and its logics, it attempts to collect these digital selves and put them in motion, tracing the possibility space of potential actions to predict and commodify. These effects of the digital and the challenges of digital representation can be felt in the modern techno-culture in attempts for greater authenticity identity on social platforms. This tension of trying to technologize the self into digital representations that don't fit reveals an already unsettled tension about how we understand the self and identity, as singular and decided. However, what if identity was already understood as rhizomatic and multiplicitous. This relationship between the self in the specific and culture at the macro level becomes more complicated when we add Blackness to the equation. Ramon Amaro's recent monograph, The Black Technical Object represents one of the most recent and comprehensive meditations on the intersection of Blackness, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Amaro sets the scene and takes up the discussion of our modern Western neurosis and obsession with data as an expression of aspirational hegemonic ideal and reification and concretization of the logics of categorization. Under assumptions of race and the logics of categorization Blackness is an object ready for analysis, consumption, and algorithmic reassembly through the white imaginary. This is present in the historical legacy and ideological/metaphysical presuppositions of machine learning. He performs this analysis by investigating the historical context and evolution of machine learning from mathematics, specifically probability and statistics, alongside a philosophical critique and psychoanalytic approach to our algorithmically driven age. Amaro's analysis ultimately advances the concept of the Black Technical Object, from which this exhibition takes its title and inspiration. Creative engagement with this concept through the exhibition, and this speculative writing piece engages with the question Amaro asks and seeks to build a generative frame to explore: How do we set the Black Technical Object free?

  

If blackness is a problem for (western) thought to paraphrase Nahum Chandler And machine learning/machinic intelligence is the concretization of thought and calculation. Then is blackness a problem for calculation? The Black technical object is the coming together of Black Pathology and the Machinic or algorithmic. Increasingly, in our time the algorithmic means artificial intelligence and machine learning. Gilbert Simondon, a French Philosopher and theorist in Science and Technology Studies, offers a speculative history of the technical which will be useful in this analysis. Simondon speaks of the bifurcation of magic into the religious and the technical. The technical is then further bifurcated into science (the theoretical) and technology (the practical). Practical can be further interpreted as in service of capitalism.  

In our modern, or perhaps post-modern era, the distinction between science and technology is in how rapidly discoveries are commodified. Artificial intelligence is interesting because it seems to bridge these bifurcations. First, bridging the theoretical and practical bifurcation with a rather rapid appropriation of theoretical insights into practical application and commodified products.

  

Artificial intelligence has taken on the nature of a fetish object, meaning it has been imbued with these metaphysical properties, a substance beyond materiality and production. For example, Dall-e is a mysterious entity that you can ask to create art on command instead of the cumulative work of millions of artists on whose work the models were trained. The machine is the assembler and synthesizer, using increasing complexity and massive amounts of underlying data to obscure its source material. The LLM speaks with the voice of a million others. Its streams of bytes start nowhere and end nowhere. And its soon-to-come successor AGI will finally answer the question that has haunted us since the enlightenment, what is intelligence? An answer will come and stochastically parroted back to us thousands of years of Western thought. 

  

The idea of a general intelligence is the further enshrining of what intelligence means in the hands of an elite that seeks to reproduce the same global capital power relations but is explicitly driven by ideologies that have at their root in the racial and eugenicist ordering of society (see Meredith Whittaker’s work on plantation logics and Timnit Gebru’s work on Eugenics and AGI). In the face of this coming future, we return to our generative question: How do we set the Black Technical Object free?

  

I would be presumptuous to offer a solution to this seemingly intractable problem, but I would like to offer a provocation to this discussion. Much of the discussion of AGI and machine learning intelligence are rife with technosolutionist rhetoric deeply embedded in ideological commitments masked as truth. Part of this is the assumption that machinic intelligence is the truth since it is based on "concrete" data or analysis. This is simply a deep example of the technocultural fallacy of mistaking the map for the territory, measurement as truth, and reality instead of an abstraction. I would like to return to the Fanon quote used as a guide quote in that my analyzing data, machinic intelligence, and ideologies, I hope to destroy it and in its wake begin to move towards a way of understanding computation not as truth or concretization or as a tool. Amaro often tells the story of Marvin Minsky and his view of talking about AI as a plaything with the goal being the discovery of interesting ideas. This may seem like a naive viewpoint, but it gets into the space of not conceptualizing technologies as that which is in service to capital and turns the black subjects into technical objects and available equipment

  

There's something unique about the coming together of the human and technical to create something neither could've individually. There are ways that AI can be and has been used by in the creative process: Increasing scale, increasing efficiency and ability, and generative art as a creative discovery tool. All of these require the human in the loop, and contrary to what some would say, labor exists at some point in the process, whether valued or not. We must develop a more discerning eye toward creative content, what we engage with, and what is meaningful. The entrance of automation into the sphere complicates our relationship to art and creative. Is it for consumption or for art to continue to be engaging and challenging? There will always be elevator music, hallway art, fluff pieces, and most importantly, ads, art that helps to facilitate capitalism and consumption.

  

The issue with much of the prevailing thought in post-humanism is that it thinks that the key to emancipation is the displacement of the human with technology. However this already presupposes a certain understanding of labor and power relations, and also misunderstands the problem as humans need to be freed up from labor instead of questioning the mode of production and capital allocation. Post-human is a fraught phrase. The trouble with post-humanism is by assuming a lack of critical engagement or questioning with what the human. Design and the creative act is both informed by Fred Moten's swarm of ontology, phenomenology, and politics and also creates new modes of being. The creative act enters into relation with the machinic and, when performed without the presupposition of the primacy of the algorithm, threatens to upend the order that the futurist would impose upon the world. Again we return to our generative question but with a few questions.

  

How might we renegotiate a relationship between black creativity and machinic intelligence? How might the Black technical object be free from the white gaze and gaze back at itself? How might the Black technical object finally set itself free?
