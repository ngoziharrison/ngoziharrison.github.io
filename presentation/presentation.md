# Meet Frances Corry
- Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Culture & Data Stewardship at the University of Pittsburgh
- Earned my PhD in Communication at the University of Southern California
- Current work employs critical-historical approaches to information, examining the prehistories and afterlives of data-intensive systems – from social media platforms to AI systems

 Intersectionality is a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw and describes approaches understanding social phenomena and systems by centering interlocking systems of oppression to make visible normative value systems that valorize heteronormativity, patriarchy, whiteness, etc. Intersectionality was originally developed within legal studies and has been leveraged as a wide variety of disciplines

---


Another important critical scholar is Patricia Hill Collins who builds on the concept of intersectionality and introduces the matrix of domination. Matrix thinking provides a paradigm for us to understand the many dimensions of of how one might experience domination or oppression, particularly focused on Black women

“Yet by putting marginality at the center of analyses (Star 1990)—in particular, by foregrounding the experiences of women of color in these technological regimes—we reveal the normative standards in these systems, going beyond inputs and outputs to inner workings.” (Gipson et al., p. 230)

# Two important mental models for data work labor and AI
- Potempkin Villages
- Mechanical Turk

---
Mechanical turk was an 18th century "chess playing Robot" which actually hid a person inside who operated the machine

Potemkin Village is a term used to refer to an fake external facade that attempts to make a situation look better or flashier then it truly is. The term comes from the story of fake villages made by Grigory Potemkin a field marshall of the Russian Empire in the 18th century to impress Catherine the Great when she visited Crimea after it's annexation from the Ottoman Empire

# Why focus on labor when discussing technology?
- Often, when we talk about technology, we focus on the consumer side; however, this can cause us to miss the more opaque and mundane ways in which technology operates
- Workers lives are increasingly controlled by algorithms that are used by corporations to maximize efficiency
- Focusing on labor when discussing technology reveals the often hidden ways that technology and those in power control society and use technology for domination. We also can find ways of resisting or using technology for justice and liberation
- Alongside transformations in information and communication technologies (ICTs) and revolutions in industrialization, labor practices have changed. Our goal is to study these changes.

---
# Finding Sources
- Look at previous papers you have written for this class and find sources that were helpful to you in the past
- Use reading together discussion posts
- Check the the citations page of readings you are currently citing in your paper
- Depth not Quantity


---
# Make your analytical framework explicit

In your thesis statement introduce the perspective and analytical framework you are bringing to the paper

---

“We approach big data’s archives through intersectionality (Crenshaw 1989, 1991) and continue the work begun by Noble and Tynes (2016) to argue that an intersectional approach sheds light on big data’s archives in particularly useful ways.” (Gipson et al., p. 228)

---
“In this paper, we ask: What ideologies are driving the race to attempt to build AGI? To answer this question, we analyze primary sources by leading figures investing in, advocating for, and attempting to build AGI. Disturbingly, we trace this goal back to the Anglo-American eugenics movement, via transhumanism.” (Gebru and Torres, 2024, p. 2)

“This book is a guide to identifying AI snake oil and AI hype. In it, we’ll give you essential vocabulary to tease apart generative AI, predictive AI, and other types of AI.” (Kapoor and Narayanan, 2024, p. 3)

# Define key terms
As you introduce your argument define key terms, both technical and conceptual, which will provide the foundation for your analysis

---
# Guide to Editing 
- Writing isn't linear
- Editing is a process of critically reflecting on your own writing

---
# Local vs Global Revision
- Local revision focuses on changes to individual words and sentences
- Global revision considers structure, evidence, clarity, flow, and mechanics
